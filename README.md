The **3D DOM Splitter** is a simple script written in plain JavaScript that transforms any website into a 3D view. By using this script, you can visually split the DOM elements into layers, providing a unique perspective of the webpage. 

## How It Works

The 3D DOM Splitter uses CSS transforms to manipulate the depth and position of the elements on the page, creating a three-dimensional effect.

## How to Use

To use the 3D DOM Splitter, follow these steps:

1. **Open the Developer Console**: Right-click anywhere on the page, select "Inspect" or press `Ctrl + Shift + I` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd + Option + I` (Mac) to open the developer tools.
2. **Paste the Code in the Console**: Go to the "Console" tab in the developer tools and paste the code you copied.
3. **Press Enter**: Hit Enter to run the script. The webpage will transform into a 3D view!

## Important Notes

- **Performance**: This script modifies the styles of all elements on the page, which might cause performance issues on pages with a large number of DOM elements.
- **Compatibility**: The script works best on modern browsers that support CSS transforms and 3D effects.
